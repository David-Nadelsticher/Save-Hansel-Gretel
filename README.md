## About The Game

Save Hansel & Gretel is a 2D single‑player side‑scroller in which you play as the **Fire Warrior**, a brave hero armed with sword and flame. You plunge into the Dark Forest to rescue Hansel and Gretel from the clutches of an evil witch—and you have only **five minutes** before the children’s fate is sealed.  

Along the way you’ll battle cunning forest creatures, gather magical breads to sustain your life and energy, and confront the witch in a climactic boss fight. Every second counts: will you save the siblings in time, or will darkness prevail?

## Core Mechanics

- **Five‑Minute Timer**  
  A looming countdown drives every decision—if the clock hits zero, it’s game over.

- **Melee Combat**  
  - **Normal Sword Strike** for quick, low‑cost attacks.  
  - **Flaming Blade Special** unleashes higher damage but requires energy or special pickups.

- **Health & Energy**  
  Touching enemies or traps drains health. Collect breads to restore life or recharge special‑attack energy.

- **Boss Encounter**  
  Face the witch in her cauldron chamber; only by depleting her multiple phases can you free Hansel and Gretel.

- **Win/Loss Conditions**  
  - **Win:** Defeat the witch and reach the children before time or health runs out.  
  - **Lose:** Time or health depletes to zero.

## Enemy Types

All enemies — including the witch — are crafted from lollipop (candy on a stick), giving them a whimsical yet unsettling appearance.

- **Zombie Predator**  
  A lumbering, sugar-coated undead creature that tries to grab and incapacitate the Fire Warrior. Its slow but relentless pursuit forces you to stay on the move.

- **Chocolate Rifle Trooper**  
  A candy-stick soldier armed with a chocolate rifle. Shoots medium‑damage chocolate rounds from a distance. Requires multiple hits to defeat.

- **Chocolate Shotgun Brute**  
  A sturdy lollipop fiend wielding a chocolate shotgun. Deals heavy close‑range damage—but falls in one well‑placed hit.

- **Witch Boss**  
  The ultimate lollipop menace, with multiple attack phases from her bubbling cauldron. Conquering her frees Hansel & Gretel.
